# My Alakajam! 2 Entry

Try my "Ocean Scanner" game at [oparisy.github.io/Alakajam2](https://oparisy.github.io/Alakajam2/).

## Development
To run locally, `git clone`, then use as an example `python -m http.server --bind localhost 8000` to serve files locally (see https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255).

The loader is SystemJS, so that I could use some modules. No bundler nor npm this time.
